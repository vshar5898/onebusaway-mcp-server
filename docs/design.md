## Overview

MCP server wrapping the [OneBusAway REST API](https://developer.onebusaway.org/api/where) — the open-source real-time transit data platform used by multiple US transit agencies. Primary instance is Puget Sound (King County Metro, Sound Transit, Pierce Transit, Community Transit, Kitsap Transit, Washington State Ferries, and others). Other instances include NYC MTA, Tampa, San Diego.

The server provides real-time arrivals, vehicle tracking, route/stop discovery, and schedule lookup. It is read-only — trip planning is out of scope (OneBusAway defers to OpenTripPlanner for routing).

**Target users:** agents helping riders ("when's the next bus?", "where is the 44 right now?", "what stops are near Pike Place Market?") and agents building transit-aware workflows (schedule analysis, delay monitoring, route research).

---

## Requirements

- Read-only access to transit data: agencies, routes, stops, arrivals, vehicles, schedules, trip status
- Multi-instance: configurable `ONEBUSAWAY_BASE_URL` (default: Puget Sound) and `ONEBUSAWAY_API_KEY` (default: `TEST`)
- Real-time predictions: arrivals return both scheduled and predicted times with schedule deviation in seconds
- Service alert passthrough: arrivals and trip status responses include active situation IDs and summaries when present
- No trip planning — direct users to transitapp.com, Google Maps, or OpenTripPlanner
- Rate limits: the Puget Sound instance rate-limits at ~20 req/min from a single IP; service should surface 429 with a retry hint

---

## Services

| Service | Wraps | Used By |
|:--------|:------|:--------|
| `OneBusAwayService` | `onebusaway-sdk` npm client | All tools |

Single service, single SDK client. Initialized once at startup with `baseURL` and `apiKey` from env config, and `maxRetries: 0` to disable the SDK's built-in retry — the service layer's `withRetry` handles retries instead. All tool handlers call through the service — no direct HTTP in handlers.

---

## Config

| Env Var | Required | Description |
|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| `ONEBUSAWAY_API_KEY` | No (defaults to `TEST`) | API key for the OneBusAway instance. `TEST` works on Puget Sound for development. |
| `ONEBUSAWAY_BASE_URL` | No (defaults to Puget Sound) | Base URL of the OneBusAway instance. Override to target NYC (`https://bustime.mta.info`), Tampa (`https://api.tampa.onebusaway.org`), or a self-hosted instance. |

---

## Domain Mapping

| Noun | Operations | API Endpoint(s) |
|:-----|:-----------|:----------------|
| Agency | list, get | `agencies-with-coverage`, `agency/{id}` |
| Stop | find (by location), find (by code), get, list-for-agency, list-for-route, search | `stops-for-location`, `stop/{id}`, `stops-for-agency/{id}`, `stops-for-route/{id}`, `search/stop` |
| Route | find (by location), get, list-for-agency, search | `routes-for-location`, `route/{id}`, `routes-for-agency/{id}`, `search/route` |
| Arrival/Departure | list (for stop), get (single) | `arrivals-and-departures-for-stop/{id}`, `arrival-and-departure-for-stop/{id}` |
| Trip | get details, get for vehicle | `trip-details/{id}`, `trip-for-vehicle/{id}`, `trips-for-route/{id}` |
| Vehicle | list (for agency) | `vehicles-for-agency/{id}` |
| Schedule | get for stop, get for route | `schedule-for-stop/{id}`, `schedule-for-route/{id}` |

Not every operation becomes a tool. Operations used only for resolution (e.g., `stop-ids-for-agency`, `route-ids-for-agency`) are omitted — they're implementation details of the service layer, not agent-facing operations.

---

## Implementation Order

1. `OneBusAwayService` — SDK client init, all API calls, typed response shapes
2. Config (`server-config.ts`) — `ONEBUSAWAY_API_KEY`, `ONEBUSAWAY_BASE_URL`
3. Discovery tools: `onebusaway_list_agencies`, `onebusaway_find_stops`, `onebusaway_find_routes`
4. Search tools: `onebusaway_search_stops`, `onebusaway_search_routes`
5. Entity fetch tools: `onebusaway_get_stop`, `onebusaway_get_route`
6. Real-time tools: `onebusaway_get_arrivals`, `onebusaway_get_trip`, `onebusaway_get_vehicles`
7. Schedule tools: `onebusaway_get_schedule_for_stop`, `onebusaway_get_schedule_for_route`
8. Agency tools: `onebusaway_list_routes_for_agency`
9. Resources: `onebusaway://stop/{stopId}`, `onebusaway://route/{routeId}`

Each step is independently testable.

## Workflow Analysis

The core agent workflow for "when's the next bus?" is a two-step chain:

| # | Tool | Purpose |
|:--|:-----|:--------|
| 1 | `onebusaway_find_stops` or `onebusaway_search_stops` | Resolve location or stop name to a stop ID |
| 2 | `onebusaway_get_arrivals` | Fetch real-time predictions using the stop ID |

For "where is the 44 right now?":

| # | Tool | Purpose |
|:--|:-----|:--------|
| 1 | `onebusaway_search_routes` | Resolve "44" to route ID `1_100225` |
| 2 | `onebusaway_get_vehicles` | List vehicles on that route, filtered by `routeId` |

For "what's the schedule for route 44 today?":

| # | Tool | Purpose |
|:--|:-----|:--------|
| 1 | `onebusaway_search_routes` | Resolve to route ID |
| 2 | `onebusaway_get_schedule_for_route` | Full day schedule |

For "is my bus late?":

| # | Tool | Purpose |
|:--|:-----|:--------|
| 1 | `onebusaway_get_arrivals` | Gets a specific arrival with `tripId` and `scheduleDeviation` |
| 2 | `onebusaway_get_trip` (optional) | Deeper vehicle status if needed |

The arrivals response is designed to answer "is my bus late?" in one call — `scheduleDeviation` on each arrival, plus `situationIds` for active alerts. `onebusaway_get_trip` is the follow-up for "show me where the bus is on the map."

---

## Design Decisions

### SDK vs. direct HTTP

**Decision: use `onebusaway-sdk`.**

The official TypeScript SDK (`onebusaway-sdk` on npm, Stainless-generated from an OpenAPI spec) covers all relevant endpoints, has full TS types, handles retries with exponential backoff by default (2 retries, with 429/408/500+ retried automatically), and supports `baseURL` override for multi-instance targeting. The SDK's retry behavior is a near-exact match to the framework's `withRetry` pattern — using both would double-retry. Plan: disable SDK retries (`maxRetries: 0`) and let the service layer's `withRetry` handle it for consistent behavior visible in telemetry.

Direct HTTP would gain nothing here and lose the typed response shapes.

### Multi-instance support

**Decision: single config, no per-call override.**

Two env vars (`ONEBUSAWAY_BASE_URL`, `ONEBUSAWAY_API_KEY`) configure the target instance at startup. A per-call `baseUrl` override parameter was considered but rejected: it creates a security surface (SSRF), complicates the service init pattern, and doesn't match any real agent use case — agents don't switch instances mid-session. Users targeting different cities configure a different server instance or use separate env var profiles.

### Search endpoints vs. location-based discovery

**Decision: expose both search and location-based tools as separate tools.**

The API has two orthogonal discovery paths: location-based (`stops-for-location`, `routes-for-location`) and name-based search (`search/stop`, `search/route`). These serve different agent workflows: "stops near Pike Place Market" vs. "find stop 75403". Merging them into one tool with a `mode` parameter would complicate the common case — the inputs don't overlap and the resolution path differs. Keeping them as `_find_*` (location) and `_search_*` (name/code) is cleaner.

### Real-time vs. scheduled data

**Decision: unified arrivals, separate schedule tools.**

`onebusaway_get_arrivals` returns both predicted (real-time) and scheduled data in every response — the `predicted` boolean on each arrival tells the agent whether GPS is backing the estimate. This is the most important signal for a rider. Separate real-time/scheduled tools would fragment the primary use case ("when's the next bus?") and force the agent to decide up front whether GPS tracking matters.

Schedule tools (`get_schedule_for_stop`, `get_schedule_for_route`) are separate because they serve a different goal — planning, not "right now" — and return full-day timetable data rather than a windowed departure list.

### `arrivals-and-departures-for-location` endpoint

**Decision: omit.**

The SDK exposes `arrivalsAndDeparturesForLocation` which returns arrivals near a lat/lon without a stop ID. This seems convenient but is problematic: it returns a flat list of arrivals from multiple stops, with no clear stop grouping, making the output hard for an agent to reason about. The two-step `find_stops` → `get_arrivals` workflow is only marginally more work and produces cleaner, more actionable output. The location arrivals endpoint is deferred.

### `trips-for-location` endpoint

**Decision: omit.**

Returns active trips near a location but the response shape is sparse (live probe confirmed zero trips returned near downtown Seattle with a 500m radius). The use case — "what buses are driving near me right now?" — is better served by `get_vehicles` (which returns all vehicles for an agency with full status) than a location-filtered trip list with thin data. Deferred.

### Service alerts as inline data

**Decision: inline situations into arrivals responses.**

The OBA response for `arrivals-and-departures-for-stop` includes a `references.situations` block for active service alerts affecting the stop. Rather than requiring a separate alert lookup tool, the `onebusaway_get_arrivals` handler will join the referenced situations into the response body. This surfaces the most relevant information (delays, detours, stop changes) inline with the arrival data, saving a round trip and matching the mental model of "check arrivals + check alerts at once."

### Resources scope

**Decision: stop and route resources only.**

Resources are a convenience surface for clients that support injectable context. Stop and route metadata are stable, addressable by ID, and frequently referenced across tools — they're a good fit for `onebusaway://stop/{stopId}` and `onebusaway://route/{routeId}`. Trip and vehicle state change too fast to be useful as cacheable resources. Agency metadata is covered by `list_agencies` (no stable single-agency URI pattern needed by agents).

### ID format (agency-prefixed)

**Decision: document the format prominently in all `stopId`/`routeId` parameter descriptions.**

OBA IDs use an `{agencyId}_{localId}` format (e.g. `1_75403` for Metro Transit stop 75403, `40_100239` for Sound Transit route). This is not intuitive. Every tool that accepts or returns an ID will document this format in `.describe()` text with examples. The arrivals and stops-near-location tools both return IDs in this format, so agents chaining calls will see the format in the response.

## Known Limitations

- **No trip planning.** OneBusAway does not include routing between origin and destination. Direct users to transitapp.com, Google Maps, or OpenTripPlanner for journey planning.
- **Rate limits undocumented but enforced.** The Puget Sound instance enforces rate limits (observed: ~20 req/min per IP). The server will surface 429 with a retry hint. Production use of the TEST key should be replaced with a registered key.
- **Predicted data requires GPS.** Many agencies report vehicles on schedule only. `predicted=false` arrivals are schedule-based estimates. `vehiclePosition` and `scheduleDeviation` are only meaningful when `predicted=true`.
- **Stop IDs are instance-specific.** A stop ID from the Puget Sound instance is not valid on NYC or Tampa. When targeting multiple instances, stop IDs from one cannot be used with another.
- **Schedule data is static.** Schedule tools return GTFS static data. They do not reflect real-time service modifications (cancellations, added trips) unless the OBA instance has a GTFS-RT service alert feed configured.
- **trips-for-location is sparse.** Live testing against the Puget Sound instance showed zero results from a 500m radius query near downtown Seattle. The endpoint is not exposed; use `get_vehicles` instead.
- **Shape/polyline data excluded.** Route and trip shape polylines are returned by some endpoints but are omitted from tool outputs — they're large encoded strings that consume context budget without adding decision-making value for an agent. Expose via `onebusaway_get_route` if a mapping use case emerges.

## API Reference

### Response envelope

All endpoints return:
```json
{ "code": 200, "currentTime": 1779558930130, "data": { ... }, "text": "OK", "version": 2 }
```
Non-2xx codes map to errors: 400 (bad request), 401 (bad API key), 404 (not found), 500 (server error), 429 (rate limited — not in the standard OBA spec but enforced by the Puget Sound hosted instance).

### References block

Most responses include a `data.references` block with related entities (agencies, routes, stops, trips, situations) keyed by ID. The OBA SDK does not automatically join these; the service layer must manually resolve references from the `references` block into the tool response.

### Timestamps

All times are Unix milliseconds (not seconds). Service dates (for grouping trips) are milliseconds since epoch at midnight local time. `currentTime` on each response can be used to compute countdown timers relative to predicted arrival times.

### Stop ID format

`{agencyId}_{stopCode}` — e.g. `1_75403` (Metro Transit stop 75403). Agency IDs on the Puget Sound instance: `1` (Metro Transit), `40` (Sound Transit), `3` (Pierce Transit), `29` (Community Transit), `19` (Intercity Transit), `95` (WA State Ferries), `20` (Kitsap Transit), `97` (Everett Transit).

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|:-----|:---------|:----------|
| 2026-05-23 | Use `onebusaway-sdk` npm package | Official, TS-native, Stainless-generated from OpenAPI spec; covers all endpoints; built-in retry; `baseURL` override for multi-instance. |
| 2026-05-23 | Disable SDK retries; use service-layer `withRetry` | Prevents double-retry and keeps retry behavior visible in framework telemetry. |
| 2026-05-23 | Single startup config, no per-call `baseUrl` override | Per-call override is an SSRF vector with no real agent use case; multi-city use is a configuration concern, not a runtime concern. |
| 2026-05-23 | Separate `_find_*` (location) and `_search_*` (name) tools | Inputs don't overlap; merging under a `mode` enum complicates the common case without benefit. |
| 2026-05-23 | Unified arrivals tool (real-time + scheduled) | The agent's primary question — "when's the next bus?" — is answered by one call; `predicted` boolean distinguishes GPS-backed from schedule-only estimates. |
| 2026-05-23 | Inline service alerts into arrivals response | Joining `references.situations` into the arrivals response saves a round trip and surfaces the most relevant operational information at the point of use. |
| 2026-05-23 | Omit `arrivals-and-departures-for-location` | Flat multi-stop arrivals list is harder for agents to reason about; `find_stops` + `get_arrivals` is only marginally more work and produces cleaner output. |
| 2026-05-23 | Omit `trips-for-location` | Live testing returned zero results; `get_vehicles` + route filter is a more reliable substitute. |
| 2026-05-23 | Omit shape/polyline data | Large encoded strings with no decision-making value for an agent; can be added later if a mapping use case emerges. |
| 2026-05-23 | Stop + route resources only | Stop/route metadata is stable and ID-addressable; trip/vehicle state changes too fast for cacheable resources. |
